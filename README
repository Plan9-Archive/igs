Play Go in plan9front, localy or on IGS.
Automatic scoring has turned out to be much harder than initially thought,
detecting dead groups is complicated. I will probably add a version with
consensus: players themselves remove the dead groups.

The planned roadmap is:
[x] Display a goban on which one can place stones.
[x] Go engine.
[ ] IGS telnet client.

Options:
[ ] GTP?
[ ] Read & write SGF?
[ ] Scoring?

IGS offers sgf commands in the telnet interface, this might be the best option.

files:
goban.c main file, manages the ui.
go.c go engine.
